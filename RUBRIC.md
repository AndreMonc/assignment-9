## Task 1

Write a program that includes 5 different functions each of which demonstrates one of 5 **different** string methods. As always, your program should contain a `main` loop and an `ifmain` statement.

- [ ] Program is correctly formatted (0.5 pt)
- [ ] Program includes `main()` function and "ifmain" statement (0.5 pt)
- [ ] Program uses 5 functions to show 5 string methods and functions correctly (2 pts total; 0.4 points each function)

## Task 2

Write a program that processess these data to split them by line ending, replaces the tab separations with commas, and prints out the result - line-by-line. As always, your program should contain a `main` loop and an `ifmain` statement.

- [ ] Program is correctly formatted (0.5 pt)
- [ ] Program includes `main()` function and "ifmain" statement (0.5 pt)
- [ ] Program correctly processes data - it prints the data line-by-line, reformatted from tab-delimited to comma-delimited (3 pts.)

## Task 3

Write a program that takes the given list (using argparse) as input, and passes the list to a function.  Within the function, use iteration to remove every even-numbered item from the list, and return only the list containing odd numbers to the `main` loop.  Print the list of odd numbers from the main loop.  As always, your program should contain a `main` loop and an `ifmain` statement.

- [ ] Program is correctly formatted (0.5 pt)
- [ ] Program includes `main()` function and "ifmain" statement (0.5 pt)
- [ ] Program correctly removes even-numbered elements from the list using iteration, returns this list, and prints this list from the main loop (3 pts.)


## Task 4

Why do you see these different behaviors between `function1` and `function2`?  Answer the question for each function by copying the code below to `task5.py` within your github username directory and adding your explanation to each function as a **function description**.

- [ ] Correct answer for function 1, as a function description (2 pts)
- [ ] Correct answer for function 2, as a function description (2 pts)
